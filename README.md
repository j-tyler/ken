# ken
A self-orchestration tool for AI agents. Solves the continuity problem: AI instances have no memory between sessions. Ken rebuilds understanding through "kennings" — ordered generative prompts that make agents construct knowledge rather than receive it. Built so AI can maintain context across sessions and build complex systems.
